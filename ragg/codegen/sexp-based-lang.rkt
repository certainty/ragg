#lang racket/base

;; A language level for automatically generating parsers out of BNF grammars.
;;
;; Danny Yoo (dyoo@hashcollision.org)
;;
;; Intent: make it trivial to generate languages for Racket.  At the
;; moment, I find it painful to use parser-tools.  This library is
;; meant to make it less agonizing.
;;
;; The intended use of this language is as follows:
;;
;;;;; s-exp-grammar.rkt ;;;;;;;;;
;; #lang ragg
;; s-exp : "(" s-exp* ")" | ATOM
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;


;; What this generates is:
;;
;;     * parse: a function that consumes a source and a
;;       position-aware lexer, and produces a syntax object.
;;
;;     * make-rule-parser: a custom parser given a provided start rule.
;; 
;; You'll still need to do a little work, by providing a lexer that
;; defines what the uppercased tokens mean.  For example, you can
;; use the parser-tools/lex lexer tools:
;;
;; (require ragg/support
;;          parser-tools/lex
;;          parser-tools/lex-sre)
;;
;; (define tokenize
;;   (lexer-src-pos
;;     [(:+ alphabetic)
;;      (token 'ATOM lexeme)]
;;     [whitespace
;;      (return-without-pos (tokenize/1 input-port))]
;;     [(:or "(" ")")
;;      (token lexeme lexeme)]))
;;

;; However, that should be all you need.  The output of an
;; generated grammar is an honest-to-goodness syntax
;; object with source locations, fully-labeled by the rules.
;;
;; (parse (tokenize an-input-port))
;;
;;

;; The first rule is treated as the start rule; any successful parse
;; must finish with end-of-file.


;; Terminology:
;;


;; A rule is a rule identifier, followed by a colon ":", followed by a
;; pattern.

;; A rule identifier is an identifier that is not in upper case.
;; A rule identifier should follow the Racket rules for identifiers,
;; except that it can't contain * or +.
;;
;; A token is a rule identifier that is all in upper case.



;; A pattern may either be 
;;
;;   * an implicit sequence of patterns,
;;
;;   * a literal string,
;;
;;   * a rule identifier,
;;
;;   * a quanitifed pattern, either with "*" or "+",
;;
;;   * an optional pattern: a pattern surrounded by "[" and "]", or
;;
;;   * a grouped sequence: a pattern surrounded by "(" and ")".
