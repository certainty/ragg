; This should be illegal too:
; #lang ragg
; a : "a" b
; b : a | b 


;;
;; I need to ask about the behavior of:
;;
;; #lang ragg
;; x : x
;;
;; which is giving me the weird error message:
;; 
;; parser-productions: A production for a non-terminal must be (non-term right-hand-side ...) with at least 1 right hand side in: (atok)


;; We need to handle this ourselves before passing to cfg-parser.
;; What we need is an algorithm to check that a BNF grammar has at least
;; one finite derivation.  It's a graph algorithm, almost like
;; topsort...
